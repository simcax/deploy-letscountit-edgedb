# ArgoCD managed deployment of edgedb
This is my deployment repo for edgedb in my homelab kundernetes cluster.

I had edgedb deployed with postgres as a backend at fly.io - but it fairly quickly added some costs, which I was not prepared to pay at the time. 
So this is my attempt to get it deployed locally instead.
